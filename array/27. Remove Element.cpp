Given an array nums and a value val, remove all instances of that value in-place and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

The order of elements can be changed. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.

Clarification:

Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?

Note that the input array is passed in by reference, which means a modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.

Internally you can think of this:

// nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
int len = removeElement(nums, val);

// any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
// using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.
for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    print(nums[i]);
}

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3
Output: 2, nums = [2,2]
Explanation: Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.
It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length. For example if you return 2 with nums = [2,2,3,3] or nums = [2,2,0,0], your answer will be accepted.

// brute force
class Solution {
public:
    int removeElement(vector<int>& nums, int val) {
        // must declare size because the nums.size() will stay the same
        int size = nums.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            if (val == nums[i]) {
                for (int j = i + 1; j < size; j++) {
                    nums[j-1] = nums[j];
                }
                i--;
                size--;
            }
        }
        return size;
    }
};

// fast slow pointer
class Solution {
public:
    int removeElement(vector<int>& nums, int val) {
        int slowIndex = 0;
        
        for (int fastIndex = 0; fastIndex < nums.size(); fastIndex++) {
            if (val != nums[fastIndex]) {
                nums[slowIndex++] = nums[fastIndex];
            }
        }
        
        return slowIndex;
    }
};
