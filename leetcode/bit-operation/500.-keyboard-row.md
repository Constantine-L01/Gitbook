# 500. Keyboard Row

Given an array of strings `words`, return *the words that can be typed using letters of the alphabet on only one row of American keyboard like the image below.

In the American keyboard:

* the first row consists of the characters `"qwertyuiop"`,
* the second row consists of the characters `"asdfghjkl"`, and
* the third row consists of the characters `"zxcvbnm"`.

Example 1:

> Input: words = ["Hello","Alaska","Dad","Peace"]
> 
> Output: ["Alaska","Dad"]

Example 2:

> Input: words = ["omk"]
> 
> Output: []

Example 3:

> Input: words = ["adsdf","sfd"]
> 
> Output: ["adsdf","sfd"]

Constraints:

* 1 <= words.length <= 20
* 1 <= words[i].length <= 100
* words[i] consists of English letters (both lowercase and uppercase).

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> findWords(vector<string>& words) {
        vector<int> dict(26, 0);
        vector<string> rows = {"QWERTYUIOP", "ASDFGHJKL", "ZXCVBNM"};
        vector<string> ret;
        
        for(int i = 0; i < rows.size(); i++){
            for(char C: rows[i]){
                // i is 0 for "QWERTYUIOP", so 001 for each character in the string.
                // i is 1 for "ASDFGHJKL", so 010 for each character in the string.
                dict[C - 'A'] = 1 << i;
            }
        }
        
        for(string w: words){
            // use 111 (7) since there are only three rows
            int r = 7;
            for(char c: w){
                // will become 000 if the current word could not complete with only 1 row. 
                // which means each row lacks at least one character for current word. 
                r &= dict[toupper(c) - 'A'];
                if(r == 0){
                    break;
                }
            }
            if(r) {
                ret.push_back(w);
            }
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
};
