# 59. Spiral Matrix II

Given a positive integer `n`, generate an `n x n matrix` filled with elements from `1` to `n`<sup>`2`</sup> in spiral order.

Example 1:

> Input: n = 3
> 
> Output: [[1,2,3],[8,9,4],[7,6,5]]

Example 2:

> Input: n = 1
> 
> Output: [[1]] 

Constraints:

> 1 <= n <= 20

## C++

### 1) Solution that consider square matrix with odd column and row that will leave middle position untouched.

1. When n equal to 1, there will be no loop.
2. When n equal to 2, there will still be no loop.
3. When n equal to 3, there will be 1 loop and one extra slot at mid. 
4. When n equal to 4, there will be 2 loop and no extra slot.
5. When n equal to 5, there will be 2 loop and one extra slot at mid.
6. So, loop = n/2, mid = n/2, and only assign mid when n is odd. 
7. n/2 will always equal to the mid index provided n is odd and index starts at 0, i.e. n == 9, divides by 2 will get 4, which 1, 2, 3, |4|, 5, 6, 7, 8, and add the 0 index while 8 is the last index.
```C++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> generateMatrix(int n) {
        vector<vector<int>> res(n, vector<int>(n, 0));
        // loop = n/2 because every loop will eliminate 2 columns and 2 row.
        int loop = n/2;
        // mid = n/2 will be fine as 0 will count as first element
        int mid = n/2;
        int offset = 1;
        int startX = 0;
        int startY = 0;
        int count = 1;
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        
        while(loop) {
            // startY + n will go to the last element, but will stop before the offet. 
            for(; j < startY + n - offset; j++) {
                res[startX][j] = count;
                count++;
            }
            
            for(; i < startX + n - offset; i++) {
                res[i][j] = count;
                count++;
            }
            
            for(; j > startY; j--) {
                res[i][j] = count;
                count++;
            }
            
            for(; i > startX; i--) {
                res[i][j] = count;
                count++;
            }
            
            loop--;
            startY++;
            startX++;
            // each loop will consume 2 columns and 2 rows, so offset += 2
            offset += 2;
        }
        
        if(n % 2) {
            res[mid][mid] = count;
        }
        
        return res;
    }
};
```

### 2) Solution without the need to check for square matrix that has odd number of columns and rows

    -> -> ->
    ^  ->  |
    <- <-  | 
    
```C++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> generateMatrix(int n) {
        int startX = 0;
        int startY = 0;
        vector<vector<int>> res(n, vector<int>(n, 0));
        int count = 1;
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        
        while(count <= n*n) {
            cout << "Left to right" << endl;
            // go until last column 
            for(j = startY; j < n - startY ; j++) {
                cout << "startX " << startY << " j " << j << endl;
                res[startX][j] = count++;        
            }

            cout << "Top to bottom" << endl;
            // start i at one row below the starting row and start j at last column, go until last row
            for(i = startX + 1, j = n - startY - 1; i < n - startX; i++) {
                cout << "i " << i << " j " << j << endl;
                res[i][j] = count++;
            }

            cout << "Right to left" << endl;
            // start i at last row and start j at one column in front of the last column, go until first column
            for(i = n - startX - 1, j = n - startY - 2; j >= startY; j--) {
                cout << "i " << i << " j " << j << endl;
                res[i][j] = count++;
            }
       
            cout << "Bottom to top" << endl;
            // start i at last row and start j at first column, go until the row just below the initial row
            for(i = n - startX - 2, j = startY; i >= startX + 1; i--) {
                cout << "i " << i << " j " << j << endl;
                res[i][j] = count++;
            }
            startY++;
            startX++;
        }            
        return res;
    }
};    
```
