# 27. Remove Element

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `val`, remove all occurrences of `val` in `nums` in-place. The relative order of the elements may be changed.

Since it is impossible to change the length of the array in some languages, you must instead have the result be placed in the **first part** of the array `nums`. More formally, if there are `k` elements after removing the duplicates, then the first `k` elements of `nums` should hold the final result. It does not matter what you leave beyond the first `k` elements.

Return `k` after placing the final result in the first `k` slots of `nums`.

Do **not** allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by **modifying the input array** in-place with O(1) extra memory.

**Custom Judge**:

The judge will test your solution with the following code:

```
int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
int val = ...; // Value to remove
int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length.
                            // It is sorted with no values equaling val.

int k = removeElement(nums, val); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
sort(nums, 0, k); // Sort the first k elements of nums
for (int i = 0; i < actualLength; i++) {
    assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
}
```

If all assertions pass, then your solution will be **accepted**. 

Example 1:

> Input: nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3
> 
> Output: 2, nums = [2,2,_,_]
> 
> Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.
> 
> It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

Example 2:

> Input: nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2
> 
> Output: 5, nums = [0,1,4,0,3,_,_,_]
> 
> Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums containing 0, 0, 1, 3, and 4.
> 
> Note that the five elements can be returned in any order.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

Constraints:

* 0 <= nums.length <= 100
* 0 <= nums[i] <= 50
* 0 <= val <= 100

## Solution

### C++

1. Use a second for loop to discard the element and move the following elements one step forward.
```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int removeElement(vector<int>& nums, int val) {
        int size = nums.size();
        
        for(int i = 0; i < size; i++){
            // if the value of current element is the same as the required value
            if(nums[i] == val){
                // then discard the element and move all the following elements one step forward.
                for(int j = i + 1; j < size; j++){
                    nums[j - 1] = nums[j];
                }
                // maintain the same index i since there will be an increment of i at the end of the loop.
                i--;
                // reduce the size by one
                size--;
            }
        }
        
        return size;
    }
};
```

1. Use a slow pointer and a fast pointer, the fast pointer will keep moving but the slow pointer will only move if the nums[fast pointer] is not equal to the value.

2. If the nums[fast pointer] is not equal to the value, then assign nums[fast pointer] to nums[slow pointer] and move the slow pointer, effectively ignore the unwanted element and keep only the wanted element.

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int removeElement(vector<int>& nums, int val) {
        int slowPointer = 0;
        
        for(int fastPointer = 0; fastPointer < nums.size(); fastPointer++){            
            if(nums[fastPointer] != val){
                nums[slowPointer] = nums[fastPointer];
                // move the slow pointer since the assignment of element to current index is done.
                slowPointer++;
            }
        }
        
        return slowPointer;
    }
};
```
