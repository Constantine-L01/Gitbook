# 332. Reconstruct Itinerary

You are given a list of airline `tickets` where `tickets[i] = [fromi, toi]` represent the departure and the arrival airports of one flight. Reconstruct the itinerary in order and return it.

All of the tickets belong to a man who departs from `"JFK"`, thus, the itinerary must begin with `"JFK"`. If there are multiple valid itineraries, you should return the itinerary that has the smallest lexical order when read as a single string.

For example, the itinerary `["JFK", "LGA"]` has a smaller lexical order than `["JFK", "LGB"]`.
You may assume all tickets form at least one valid itinerary. You must use all the tickets once and only once.

Example 1:

> Input: tickets = [["MUC","LHR"],["JFK","MUC"],["SFO","SJC"],["LHR","SFO"]]
> 
> Output: ["JFK","MUC","LHR","SFO","SJC"]

Example 2:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/14/itinerary2-graph.jpg)

> Input: tickets = [["JFK","SFO"],["JFK","ATL"],["SFO","ATL"],["ATL","JFK"],["ATL","SFO"]]
> 
> Output: ["JFK","ATL","JFK","SFO","ATL","SFO"]
> 
> Explanation: Another possible reconstruction is ["JFK","SFO","ATL","JFK","ATL","SFO"] but it is larger in lexical order.
 
Constraints:

* 1 <= tickets.length <= 300
* tickets[i].length == 2
* from<sub>i</sub>.length == 3 
* to<sub>i</sub>.length == 3
* from<sub>i</sub> and to<sub>i</sub> consist of uppercase English letters.
* from<sub>i</sub> != to<sub>i</sub>

    }    
    
    vector<string> findItinerary(vector<vector<string>>& tickets) {
        ticketNum = tickets.size() + 1;
        for(vector<string> ticket: tickets){
            targets[ticket[0]][ticket[1]]++;
        }
        result.push_back("JFK");
