# 1893. Check if All the Integers in a Range Are Covered

You are given a 2D integer array *ranges* and two integers *left* and *right*. Each *ranges[i] = [starti, endi]* represents an inclusive interval between *starti* and *endi*.

Return *true* if each integer in the inclusive range *[left, right]* is covered by **at least one** interval in *ranges*. Return *false* otherwise.

An integer *x* is covered by an interval *ranges[i] = [starti, endi]* if *starti <= x <= endi*.

Example 1:

> Input: ranges = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]], left = 2, right = 5
> 
> Output: true
> 
> Explanation: Every integer between 2 and 5 is covered:
>
>  - 2 is covered by the first range.
> 
> - 3 and 4 are covered by the second range.
> 
> - 5 is covered by the third range.

Example 2:

> Input: ranges = [[1,10],[10,20]], left = 21, right = 21
> 
> Output: false
> 
> Explanation: 21 is not covered by any range. 

Constraints:

* 1 <= ranges.length <= 50
* 1 <= starti <= endi <= 50
* 1 <= left <= right <= 50

## Solution

### C++

```C++
class Solution {
public:    
    bool isCovered(vector<vector<int>>& ranges, int left, int right) {
        unordered_set<int> set;
        
        // collect all the numbers covered by the ranges
        for(vector<int> range: ranges){
            for(int i = range[0]; i <= range[1]; i++){
                set.insert(i);
            }
        }
        
        // traverse from left to right, if could not find a particular number covered by the interval, then it means the number is not covered by the ranges too. 
        for(int i = left; i <= right; i++){
            if(set.find(i) == set.end()){
                return false;
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }
};
```
